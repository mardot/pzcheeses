# PZ Cheeses

I have included comments as to how I would build this app if time permitted

## Available Scripts

In the project directory run:

### `npm start` && `npm run server`

JSON data is currently served by JSONserver
If the data was to be edited I would serve the data either via express or a mongoDB via express

App is run on http://localhost:3000

Json serves from http://localhost:3001/cheeses
